# Todo CLI - Advanced Feature Expansion PRD

### TL;DR

This release brings a suite of advanced features to Todo CLI, targeting productivity-driven users by introducing support for task dependencies, seamless context switching, tagging, visual boards, robust backup/recovery, instant task capture, minimal PWA, and todo.txt compatibility. These features solve workflow fragmentation for power users and teams by streamlining task management both on the command line and via a lightweight web interface.

## User Stories

### Power User (Engineer, Designer, PM)

* As a Power User, I want to set task dependencies so that I can control order-of-execution and avoid blockers.

* As a Power User, I want to switch quickly between work/side-project/personal contexts, so that I stay organized without process overhead.

* As a Power User, I want virtual tags and boards, so I can view and group related todos visually and in the CLI.

* As a Power User, I want a quick capture feature, so I can add tasks instantly without distraction.

* As a Power User, I want to import/export todos in todo.txt format, so I can move between platforms and keep control of my data.

### New User

* As a New User, I want onboarding and guidance about advanced features, so I don’t get lost.

* As a New User, I want easy, automatic backup, so I don’t lose data if I make a mistake or my system fails.

### Occasional User

* As an Occasional User, I want a minimal web interface for light edits from anywhere, so I’m not dependent on one device.

* As an Occasional User, I want to recover lost or deleted tasks, so my task-tracking is failsafe.

## Functional Requirements

* **Task Management**

  * **Task Dependencies (High):** Enable users to link tasks as dependencies; block completion until dependencies resolve.

  * **Context Switching (High):** Allow users to define and swap between contexts (work, personal, project).

  * **Virtual Tags (High):** Support tagging of tasks for ad-hoc grouping, searchable and filterable both in CLI and PWA.

* **Visualization & Organization**

  * **Boards View (Medium):** Provide a kanban-style board interface in the minimal PWA and a CLI board summary (group by tag/status).

  * **Context and Dependency Views (Medium):** Visualize current context, outstanding dependencies, and task status in both CLI and PWA.

* **Data Safety & Portability**

  * **Backup/Recovery (High):** Implement automatic and manual backup/restore of todo lists, including dependency/metadata.

  * **Todo.txt Import/Export (High):** Full import/export for todo.txt format with support for included metadata (tags, dependencies).

* **Input & Capture**

  * **Quick Capture (High):** CLI shortcut and PWA modal for rapid, attribute-less task entry.

* **Web/PWA Experience**

  * **Minimal PWA (Medium):** A fast, responsive web/PWA for basic CRUD operations, backup, boards, and context switching.

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

* Users install or launch Todo CLI as usual; the update notification introduces new features.

* A `todo help` CLI command summarizes advanced features and new shortcuts.

* PWA users directed to a lightweight onboarding overlay explaining boards, capture, and context.

**Core Experience**

* **Step 1:** User invokes `todo add` or triggers quick capture.

  * CLI provides an optional flag for quick-add; minimal prompts to avoid friction.

  * Error handling for empty or malformed entries.

  * Confirmation shown or visually added to PWA in real-time.

* **Step 2:** User creates dependencies with `todo dep [TASK_ID] on [TASK_ID]`.

  * CLI/PWA block completion if dependencies are unresolved.

  * Clear status indicators for blocked/unblocked tasks.

* **Step 3:** User switches contexts (`todo ctx work` or selection in PWA).

  * All task lists and views instantly pivot to the relevant context.

* **Step 4:** Tagging tasks as part of add/edit flow (CLI: `todo add "Setup server" --tag devops`; PWA: select/add tags).

  * Tag-based filtering and virtual board columns.

* **Step 5:** Accessing boards (`todo board` in CLI; "Boards" tab in PWA).

  * Board view sorted by tag, dependency, or status.

* **Step 6:** Data backup or recovery via single command (`todo backup`, `todo recover`) or PWA control.

  * Success/error messaging (with undo for safety).

* **Step 7:** Import/export operation prompts for confirmation and format preview.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

* Power users chain dependencies, batch-tag, or perform multi-context quick-capture.

* Error states for impossible dependencies, circular references, or backup/restore failures are clearly surfaced.

* CLI gracefully falls back if board view not supported in terminal; PWA always shows latest.

**UI/UX Highlights**

* High-contrast CLI theming for readability; readable outputs for dependencies/blocked states.

* Responsive PWA; accessible navigation, keyboard/shortcut support, and minimal color palette.

* Undo, confirm, and preview messages for high-risk actions (delete, restore, overwrite).

## Narrative

Maya, a freelance project manager and developer, starts her day juggling multiple projects and personal errands. In her terminal, she leverages Todo CLI’s new quick capture to brain-dump tasks as they surface—no detail, just a title and move on. Between code sprints, she uses context switching (`todo ctx work` / `todo ctx freelance`) to focus on relevant lists, and tags tasks by client, project, and urgency so nothing gets lost.

One complex task, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, can’t be marked done until a teammate completes the API deployment—so she adds a dependency. The board view (`todo board`) instantly visualizes what’s blocked, letting her adjust priorities without mental overhead. At lunch, Maya pulls up the PWA on her phone, shifting a task to “urgent” and capturing an idea with a single tap.

Later, Maya accidentally deletes a critical project list. Thanks to the backup/recovery feature, she restores everything in seconds. Before the day ends, she exports all tasks for sharing via todo.txt, keeping data portable. The new features seamlessly blend CLI power with web simplicity, helping Maya stay on track and in control despite a chaotic schedule.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

* Extension of internal task models to support dependencies, tags, and contexts.

* API endpoints (local/file & PWA-sync) for CRUD, board, and backup operations.

* CLI command parser/controller updates for new flows.

* Minimal, reactive PWA with offline data sync.

* Data migration scripts for backward compatibility.

### Integration Points

* Optional sync/backup to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox—future).

* todo.txt import/export interoperability.

### Data Storage & Privacy

* Local filesystem storage; encrypted backup option (opt-in).

* Respect todo.txt field compatibility; avoid proprietary lock-in.

* Minimal analytics; opt-in for usage telemetry.

### Scalability & Performance

* Support for thousands of tasks, fast load/response locally and in browser.

* Smooth context switches and board renders with large lists.

### Potential Challenges

* Handling and surfacing circular dependencies.

* Data migration for current users—ensuring old tasks are preserved.

* Ensuring feature parity and smooth state sharing between CLI and PWA.

* Maintaining platform independence (Linux, Windows, macOS terminals).
